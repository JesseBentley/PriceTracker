# PriceTracker
A simple Amazon price tracker. You can edit the file and input your e-mail / link to the item you want to watch / and set the price threshold. Once the scraper detects the price thresh hold has been met it will e-mail you.

## Update

Created a quick mock up. May update more in the future with a GUI and more advanced options. For now this is the final build.
